# lint-prepush    [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/lint-prepush.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/lint-prepush)

> Run linters on committed files in a BranchðŸ”¬

## Getting Started ðŸ”®

This package will run linters on your project for the committed files in your branch.

### PrerequisitesðŸ”­

It require Node.js v6 or newer. It also requires a package to manage git hooks. I strongly suggest [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) which I use for most of my projects.


```js
// package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm test",
      "pre-push": "npm test",
      "...": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Installing

* This project requires a package to manage git hooks depending. 
* I strongly suggest [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) which pauses the git push by overriding pre-commit hook (it almost overrides all hooks, here we need only pre-commit hook) and allow us to run our custom scripts and resumes pushing.


### npm

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky lint-prepush
```

or using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add --dev husky lint-prepush
```

### Usage

Configure the following scripts in package.json to lint your committed files ðŸ”§. You can also follow any of the  [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) methods to configure lint-prepush.

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
+   "prepush": "lint-prepush"
  },
+ "lint-prepush": {
+    "*.js": [
+      "eslint"
+    ]
+  }
}
```

The above scrips will lint the js files while pushing to git. It will terminate the process if there are any errors, otherwise, the changes will be pushed.
